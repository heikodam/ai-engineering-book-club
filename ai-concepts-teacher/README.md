## 🌟 What You'll Learn

### Information Theory Fundamentals
- **🔢 Bits** - The basic unit of information (with interactive coin flips and calculators)
- **🎲 Entropy** - Measuring surprise and randomness (with live visualizations)
- **⚖️ Cross Entropy** - How we compare AI predictions vs reality
- **📝 Bits per Character/Byte** - Information density in text and data
- **🤯 Perplexity** - The ultimate metric for AI model confusion

### Advanced AI Concepts
- **🎯 Model Evaluation** - How to assess AI performance
- **🧮 Introduction to Embeddings** - Vector representations of data
- **⚖️ AI as a Judge** - Using AI to evaluate other AI systems
- **🔄 Comparative Evaluations** - Modern techniques for model comparison

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Interactive Demos** - Sliders, calculators, and real-time visualizations
- 📊 **Beautiful Charts** - Built with Recharts for data visualization
- 🧠 **Simple Explanations** - Complex concepts explained with everyday analogies
- 🎯 **Progressive Learning** - Each section builds on previous knowledge
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Beautiful gradients, animations, and professional design
- 🗂️ **Organized Navigation** - Sidebar with categorized sections and progress tracking
